            <h3>Considerations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Constraints of patches and upgradability – Due to the immutability of blockchains, smart contracts deployed to blockchains cannot be modified. This increases the difficulty for upgrading decentralized applications. When security flaws are detected in blockchain applications, the cost of patching the applications is high, and sometimes, a fork of the blockchain is needed.</li>
                <li>Privacy and anonymous nature of blockchain – Blockchain users can remain anonymous. Smart contract functions do not have a way to check the profile of the users. Hackers can carry out blockchain attacks, get the assets, and remain unidentified.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Practices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mitigation Plan: If there is a security hack of smart contracts, the CEO can pause or unpause the smart contract.</li>
                <li>Put a Cap to the Max Funds: This provides an additional safety guard to prevent asset loss.</li>
                <li>Smart Contract Audit: A security audit is a practice to hire an external professional company to evaluate and review token economy, smart contracts design, and code implementation.</li>
                <li>Patch security loopholes to protect blockchain-based applications from vulnerabilities and data breaches.</li>
                <li>Securely store identity keys.</li>
            </ul>
